The couple of differences that I did was to include a couple of codelines to make the code more generic, in this case the user will be promped
with a window to select the file that will be analize instead of writing the name of the file directly on the code.
Another modification was that the program wasn't able to find the Package vader_lexicon so I include a couple of lines of code to implement the workaround.
